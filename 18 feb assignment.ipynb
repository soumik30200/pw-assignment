    " SOAP or the Simple Object Access Protocol is a messaging protocol that allows for distributed elements of an application to communicate. This protocol can be carried over multiple transfer methods like HTTP and SMTP. Its data structure is based on XML and since it's largely human readable, it makes it easier to understand a SOAP message. SOAP is a concrete protocol with its own set of rules and security features like integrated ACID compliance and authorization. It's also highly complex since it requires more bandwidth and resources. It performs well in distributed enterprise environments since it doesn't assume direct point-to-point communication"
